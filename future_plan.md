3. **User Behavior Analysis**
   - Most popular content
   - Content discovery paths (which content leads to other content)
   - User retention metrics
   - Peak viewing times

4. **Content Performance**
   - Conversion rates (views to subscriptions or purchases)
   - Revenue per view
   - Content effectiveness scores
